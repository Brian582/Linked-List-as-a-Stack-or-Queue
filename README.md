# Linked List as a Stack or Queue
 
This project creates a linked list that acts as a Stack or Queue.
The linked list starts off as a Stack by default, but can be changed to a Queue and then back to a stack again.

The program has both Stack and Queue operations for adding and removing elements. However, if the linked list is set to 'Stack', it can't use the Queue operations.
If the linked list is set to 'Queue', it can't use the Stack operations.

The linked list only takes integer elements. Also, the list can be reversed and can calculate the average of the numbers in the list.

Here are the operations for the list.

# Operations

1. Stack - sets the linked list to Stack
2. Push - adds an element to the stack
3. Pop - remove an element from the stack
4. Queue - set the linked list to Queue
5. Enqueue - add an element to the queue
6. Dequeue - removes an element to the queue
7. Display - displays all the elements in the list
8. Reverse - Reverses the linked list ( Reversed using recurion )
9. Average - calculates the average of the numbers in the list
10. Help - displays all the operations for the list
11. Exit - used to exit the program
